# scala RPG based on BludBourne assets [https://github.com/patrickhoey/BludBourne]()

Hi, folks,

I want to learn scala, akka and game AI and use the book Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey as a template to
create my own RPG.

Please feel free to use my game as source of inspiration to these topics.

As you explore the contents you might have questions about my design decisions. You're invited to text me and I will try to provide an adequate answer.

Yours,

Romeo

**Currently are some performace issues while using case classes and not pure Vector2 objects for calculation, so the actors run into timeouts and this will be fixed soon or I reset to prior (working) revision.**

# Next Milestones
