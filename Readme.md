# scala RPG based on BludBourne assets [https://github.com/patrickhoey/BludBourne]()

Hi, folks,

I want to learn scala, akka and game AI and use the book Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey as a template to
create my own RPG.

Please feel free to use my game as source of inspiration to these topics.

As you explore the contents you might have questions about my design decisions. You're invited to text me and I will try to provide an adequate answer.

Yours,

thinkrapido
